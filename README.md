This game is a **One Life, Multi-Soul** 2.5D Puzzle Dungeon Escape game.

The objective of the game is to escape a large expansive dungeon that you've mysteriously been placed in. The problem is, anything will kill you. If anything touches you, it's over, and you have to start over from the beginning.. Thankfully, through powers unknown, you are able to split your soul in half. Doing so gives you another chance at life in case you meet your untimely demise. If you do die while split, your leftover soul acts as a "checkpoint" to keep your progress. If you manage to escape the dungeon, at what cost to yourself did you do it for, how much of YOU is left...
